        <h1>Privacy Policy for Light Prayer Times</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Hanis Irfan ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use the Light Prayer Times Progressive Web App (the "PWA").</p>
        <p>By using the PWA, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>Publisher Information</h2>
        <p>The Light Prayer Times PWA is published by:</p>
        <p><strong>Hanis Irfan</strong><br>
        Website: <a href="https://www.hanisirfan.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.hanisirfan.xyz</a></p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Light Prayer Times PWA does <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information from its users. We don't ask for your name, email address, or any other information that could identify you.</p>
        <p>The PWA allows you to manually select your location to calculate prayer times. This location information is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Processed locally on your device:</strong> It is used only for the purpose of calculating prayer times and is not sent to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Not stored by us:</strong> We do not store your location data or any history of your location.</li>
            <li><strong>User-controlled:</strong> Your selected location is stored directly on your device, in your browser's local storage. You can change or clear this data through the PWA's settings or your browser's settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect any usage data, analytics, or IP addresses from your use of the PWA.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data or usage data, we do not use your information for any purpose beyond enabling the PWA's core functionality (calculating prayer times based on your manual selection) on your device.</p>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share any information with third parties because we do not collect any personal or usage data from you.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not retain any personal data. All data, including your selected location, is stored locally on your device until you clear it.</p>

        <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>The security of your information is important to us. Given that the PWA primarily functions client-side and does not transmit any data to our servers, the risk associated with data breaches is significantly minimized. We maintain standard security practices for our website hosting to protect the integrity of the PWA itself.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our PWA does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from Children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your Child has used the PWA in a way that might have involved collection of personal data (though our PWA is designed not to), please contact us.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
