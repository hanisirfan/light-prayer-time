## How to Install and Use

Light Prayer Times is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you can install it directly from your browser to your device, giving it an app-like experience without needing an app store. Or, you can just browse it as usual.

### General PWA Installation Steps

Most modern browsers will show an "Install" icon or option in the address bar or menu when you visit a PWA-enabled website. Look for a house icon with a plus sign, or a similar prompt.

### Installation on Windows

#### Google Chrome (Windows)

1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to the Light Prayer Times website.
2. In the address bar, look for the Install icon (a small computer screen with an arrow pointing down, or a plus sign inside a circle/house icon).
3. Click the Install icon.
4. A prompt will appear asking if you want to install the app. Click Install.
5. The app will open in its own window, separate from your browser, and an icon will be added to your desktop and Start Menu.

#### Mozilla Firefox (Windows)

Firefox on Windows requires an extension to install PWAs.
